# Minecraft Hunger Games server manager

This plugin has been made to automate Hunger Games minigames on a Minecraft server. This plugin includes a queue system, leaderboard, world restoration and an automatic game from start to finish taking the first 90 players in the queue.  
Within this plugin, you can add as many Minecraft game worlds as you like which are put into the game circulation and after each game, the world is reset to its original state so another game can be played.

/Game worldBorder (newSize) (time)
